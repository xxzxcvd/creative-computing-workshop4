Implementation effect:
When the mouse clicks, a red circle will appear at the clicked position.
When a keyboard key is pressed, the most recently pressed key will be displayed at positions (10, 30).
When the mouse moves, it leaves a blue rectangular trajectory.

sol:

1. Introduce the p5. js library into the HTML file and create a js file to connect it.
2. In the setup function, create a canvas and set the initial environment.
3. Define variables to store information about user input events.
4. Add event handling functions for different user input events, such as mouse clicks, keyboard key presses, mouse movements, etc.
5. Implement the function of recording user input, storing user input information in arrays or objects.
6. Implement the function of reusing user input information, and perform corresponding operations based on stored user input information, such as redrawing graphics or changing graphic states




Learned how to use the mouseClicked function to handle mouse click events and store mouse click positions.
- Mastered the keyPressed function to handle keyboard key events and store keyboard key information.
- Understand how the mouseMoved function handles mouse movement events and stores mouse movement positions.
- Master how to use stored user input information in the draw function to visualize it, such as drawing circles, displaying text, and drawing rectangles.
- Learn to use arrays to store user input information and perform corresponding operations based on the stored information to achieve interactive effects
